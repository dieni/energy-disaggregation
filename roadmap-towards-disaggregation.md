# Roadmap towards smart meter disaggregation
## Goal
Goal is to disaggregate the consumption of a household in order to get the consumption of the individual devices. This should be accomplished without the use of labeled. 

Deviuces should be disaggregaten on a daily basis.

## approaches
### Feature extraction
- Probably using the python package 'tsfresh'


### Use an unsupervised machine learing algorithm
- Hidden Markov Model
- FHMM
- AFAMAP

### independend component analysis (fastICA)
