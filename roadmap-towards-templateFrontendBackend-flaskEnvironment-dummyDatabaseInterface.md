# Roadmap towards Template Frontend/Backend X Flask Environment X DummyDatabase with Interface
## Goal Summary
Goal is to analyse how the backend interacts with the frontend (React), to set up a flask environment and to creat a dummy database so that the frontend can get data as soon as possible.

## Goals
1. Template for interaction between frontend (React) and backend (Flask)
2. Set up flask environment and service
3. Creat dummy database with service interface to frontend
4. Bonus Goal: Setting up Merging Issues, how should merging on github look like

## approaches
### Get Startet with a complete applications which combines a machine learning algorithm with a UI
(https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-complete-machine-learning-web-application-using-react-and-flask-859340bddb33)
- get that thing to work
- use the aplication as template for our application

### Create dummy database
- check requirements of backend and frontend
- model a database
- create a python model and dummy data
- run the applications, create the database and fill with dummy data

### Create interface service for database access
- create service with methods for the frontend access
- create service with methods for the backend access
